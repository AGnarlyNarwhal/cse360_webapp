URL/view notes:

So to create a new view, first we create a url in: 
project/app/url.py (create it if it doesn't exist)

Then we go to project/app/views.py and define it in a function: 
def home(request): 
	return HttpResponse("Hello World!")

^This just returns hello world/no html 

So if we want to create a template for our view we can create a directory in project/app1/templates, and then create some html templates. 

Once we've created our url.py file in the app directory, and then defined our url, we need to add it to the project's main url.py file. 

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^app/', include('app.urls')), #< this is what we've included 
    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
)
